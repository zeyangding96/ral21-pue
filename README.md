# Predictive Uncertainty Estimation Using Deep Learning for Soft Robot Multimodal Sensing

This repository contains the data and code for the paper "Predictive Uncertainty Estimation Using Deep Learning for Soft Robot Multimodal Sensing" by Ze Yang Ding, Junn Yong Loo, Vishnu Monn Baskaran, Surya Girinatha Nurzaman, and Chee Pin Tan (Monash University Malaysia), to be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.

Please find the paper and the supplementary video in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343717).

## How to run

All experiments were done using Google Colaboratory. Please download `main.ipynb` and open it with Google Colab. Running the first cell in the notebook should clone this repo and then subsequent cells can be run. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training + testing, and codes to generate some figures in the paper.
